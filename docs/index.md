# Mathematical Reasoning Data Pipeline

Welcome to the Mathematical Reasoning Data Pipeline documentation.

## Overview

This project enables the creation of step-by-step mathematical reasoning examples to enhance language model training, with support for multiple datasets and distributed processing.

## Key Features

- **Flexible dataset support**: Works with multiple mathematical datasets including NuminaMath-1.5, GSM8K, MathQA, and more
- **Distributed processing**: Supports multi-GPU setups for faster data generation
- **Memory optimization**: Includes low-memory modes for processing large datasets
- **Self-improvement**: Implements an iterative approach to refine and improve generated reasoning
- **Quality evaluation**: Automatically evaluates the quality of generated reasoning
