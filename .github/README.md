# Reason Data Gen

## Description
A comprehensive pipeline for generating high-quality mathematical reasoning data using Chain-of-Thought (CoT) techniques and iterative self-improvement. This project enables the creation of step-by-step mathematical reasoning examples to enhance language model training, with support for multiple datasets and distributed processing.
